# dh10-WebApplication

This is a project i developed with other 2 guys; 
in this repo i uploaded all the src files of the web application, but there was also a substantial part in a  different backend project,
so if you try to run it will not compile but you can see the source code anyway. And you can possibly open the html files...

<h2>Project description</h2>

This web application has the porpouse to show different things without a related link between them like videogames and geography :flushed:
I know it sounds strange but our main intention was to show our different skills in different fields. For this simple application we used a lot of technologies:

<ul>
  <li> Spring </li>
  <li> Hibernate </li>
  <li> Spring MVC </li>
  <li> Angularjs </li>
  <li> HTML/CSS/JS </li>
  <li> Bootstrap </li>
</ul>

Now we can jump into the real web experience:
